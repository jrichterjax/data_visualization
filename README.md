Analysis:

    - The following data indicates that Capomulin outperformed all other drug regimens implemented in the study by Pymaceuticals with the exception of Ramicane.

    - Both Capomulin and Ramicane have significantly lower mean tumor volumes, lower variance, and a greater number of observation points (or length of study) than the other drugs tested.

    - The split between male and female observation points was relatively equal.

    - In one particular instance, in the study of mouse l509 who received the Capomulin treatment, the tumor volume initially increased moderately but subsequently decreased significantly before again rising slightly.

    - There is a strong positive correlation between mouse weight and tumor volume.
